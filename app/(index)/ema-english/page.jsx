              I'm neither a master at teaching English nor a music lover.
              However, English songs and music have played a significant role in
              my English learning journey, and I wanted to share this experience
              with others.ðŸ“šðŸ¤“

              I didn't know what "glitter" meant until I heard Dua Lipa's voice
              singing, "<i>Glitter</i> in the sky, <i>glitter</i> in our eyes,
              shining just the way we are." After that, I looked up the meaning
              of "glitter" once, and it was enough for me to remember it
              forever! Do you know why I know the meaning of "ambition"? Because
              "All my friends are toxic, all <i>ambitionless</i>, so rude and
              always negative!" (this is another song if you haven't figured it
              out.)

              EMA English was created in the summer of 2022. Weâ€”Ebrahim,
              Mohammad, and Arad (or EMA)â€”were bored and thought, "Let's do
              something!ðŸ’ª" That's when we came up with the idea to record a
              podcast and teach English through lyrics, as we had been learning
              English together using song lyrics before.

              We started recording several episodes and uploaded them to
              Castbox. Initially, we thought, "OMG, this is awful.ðŸ˜…" We had
              (and probably still have) bad microphones, and we couldn't speak
              fluently, even in Persian! But it was fun, so we kept doing it.
              After recording several episodes, we gained more subscribers than
              we expected. However, we got busy and stopped recording for a
              while. Eventually, with just a few episodes, we ended up with more
              than 500 subscribers without even telling anybody about the
              podcast!

              there will be glitter in your eyes! âœ¨ðŸ‘€
